# Attendance-Monitoring-System


Monitors daily attendance of a subject through a simple user interface.
This piece of software is only intended for use in Linux distributions and is mainly developed in python 2.7 though it may work well in future versions too.

Tough this code can be very easily modified to work in other operating systems as it uses basic Tk and Python.

It's in a very initial sate and needs to be modified to add more reliability, functionality and cross platform compatibility.
Uses few python inbuilt libraries to function and eats about 15Mb of main memory while functional.
You can freely modify and share this code by any means!


It's strictly proposed to add this code to your start-up applications so that whenever you open your computer it asks you to register your absence or presence for the later day if you've not already registered earlier that day.
Even if you miss opening you computer for few days it has a hard register functionality that'll enable you to register again after initially registering your attendance earlier that day!
It always overlaps all windows and the only way to get rid of it is to close it through the Exit button or kill it through it's process id or something!
The color of your percentage attendance label's font will change with respect to you attendance percentage.
