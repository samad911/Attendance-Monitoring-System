# Attendance-Monitoring-System
Monitors daily attendance of a subject through a simple UI
This piece of software is only intended for use in various Linux distributions and needs Python 2.7 to be the default environment.
Tough this code can be very easily modified to work in other operating systems as well who can use Python2.7 .
It's in a very initial sate and needs to be modified to add more reliability, functionality and cross platform compatibility.
Uses few python inbuilt libraries to function and eats about 15Mb of main memory while functional.
You can freely modify and share this code by any means!


It's strictly proposed to add this code to your start-up applications so that whenever you open your computer it asks you to register your absence or presence for the later day if you've not already registered earlier that day.
Even if you miss opening you computer for few days it has a hard register functionality that'll enable you to register again after initially registering your attendance earlier that day!
It always overlaps all windows until you close it through the Exit button or kill it through it's process id or something!
The color of your percentage attendance label's font will change with respect to you attendance percentage. (It's not a Bug!)

To use it:
<b>Just download the source code or clone it to a folder.
Keep all files in the same folder.
Rename the file user_name_stats.dat according to your name , </b> eg. mike_stats.dat
<b> Open the main python file and replace the keyword user_name by mike though Find and replace feature of your text editor. 
Add it to your start-up programs list.
And you're ready to go! </b>
